"""
This script demonstrates the usage of a while loop in Python.

A while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long
as a given condition remains true. The structure of a while loop looks like this:

while condition:
    # Code to execute

Below, an example is added to count numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop.
"""

# Practice Questions:
# 1. Write a while loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 20.
no = 0
while no<=20:
    print(no)
    no = no + 2
# 2. Create a while loop that keeps asking the user to input a number until they enter a negative value.


# 3. Write a while loop to compute the sum of numbers from 1 to 50.
num = 1
SUM = 0
while num <=50:
     SUM = SUM + num
     num =num + 1
     
print(sum)


count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

number = 2
while number <=10:
    print("hello friends")
    number += 1
